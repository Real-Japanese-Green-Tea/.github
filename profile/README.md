Real Japanese Green Tea Dev Squad 🍵💻
Hey there, Code Ninjas! 🥷

Welcome to the dojo of Real Japanese Green Tea's Dev Squad. We're on a quest, a quest to brew not just the finest teas, but also the most refreshing mobile apps. We're talking apps that are smoother than a perfectly steeped Sencha and more robust than a hearty Hojicha.

The Mission 🚀
We're diving deep into the world of mobile app development, and we need YOU! Yes, you, the one who dreams in binary, speaks fluent Pythonese, and can spot a misplaced semicolon from a mile away. We're looking to build mobile apps that bridge the gap between our tea-loving customers and our exquisite products. But here's the catch: we don't just want apps; we want masterpieces.

Calling All Coders! 📣
Got mad skills in React Native or Flutter? Dream about APIs and SDKs? Ever thought about how the principles of OOP are kinda like brewing tea? (Okay, maybe that's just us.) If you've got the coding chops and are ready to embark on a journey filled with caffeine and code, then saddle up!

We promise endless cups of the finest Japanese green tea (virtually, of course) and the chance to be part of a project that's as exciting as a double shot of espresso... or in our case, a Matcha Latte.

A Little Nudge (Or A Big Push) 🤓
We get it; coding is hard. But so is waiting for the water to boil just right for that perfect cup of tea. So, if you're looking to flex those coding muscles, get a little street cred in the dev community, and have some fun along the way, you're in the right place. And hey, if you can sneak in a few tea puns in the comments, we won't complain!
